This requires that a [ScrollController] is\nprovided to controller, or that the [PrimaryScrollController] is available.\n\nWhen a [ScrollView.scrollDirection] is [Axis.horizontal], it is recommended\nthat the [Scrollbar] is always visible, since scrolling in the horizontal\naxis is less discoverable.",
