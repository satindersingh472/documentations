    "description": "This example uses a [Container] that wraps a [GestureDetector] widget which\ndetects a tap.\n\nSince the [GestureDetector] does not have a child, it takes on the size of its\nparent, making the entire area of the surrounding [Container] clickable. When\ntapped, the [Container] turns yellow by setting the `_color` field. When\ntapped again, it goes back to white.",
