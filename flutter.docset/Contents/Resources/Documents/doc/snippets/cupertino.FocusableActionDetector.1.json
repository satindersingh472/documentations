    "description": "This example shows how keyboard interaction can be added to a custom control\nthat changes color when hovered and focused, and can toggle a light when\nactivated, either by touch or by hitting the `X` key on the keyboard when\nthe \"And Me\" button has the keyboard focus (be sure to use TAB to move the\nfocus to the \"And Me\" button before trying it out).\n\nThis example defines its own key binding for the `X` key, but in this case,\nthere is also a default key binding for [ActivateAction] in the default key\nbindings created by [WidgetsApp] (the parent for [MaterialApp], and\n[CupertinoApp]), so the `ENTER` key will also activate the buttons.",
