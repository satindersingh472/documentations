    "description": "The Piazzolla font supports the `case` feature. It causes\nparentheses, brackets, braces, guillemets, slashes, bullets, and\nsome other glyphs (not shown below) to be shifted up slightly so\nthat capital letters appear centered in comparison. When the\nfeature is disabled, those glyphs are optimized for use with\nlowercase letters, and so capital letters appear to ride higher\nrelative to the punctuation marks.\n\nThe difference is very subtle. It may be most obvious when\nexamining the square brackets compared to the capital A.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_case.png)",
