    "description": "Here is an example of Radio widgets wrapped in ListTiles, which is similar\nto what you could get with the RadioListTile widget.\n\nThe currently selected character is passed into `groupValue`, which is\nmaintained by the example's `State`. In this case, the first [Radio]\nwill start off selected because `_character` is initialized to\n`SingingCharacter.lafayette`.\n\nIf the second radio button is pressed, the example's state is updated\nwith `setState`, updating `_character` to `SingingCharacter.jefferson`.\nThis causes the buttons to rebuild with the updated `groupValue`, and\ntherefore the selection of the second button.\n\nRequires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.",
