    "description": "When the [Scaffold] is actually created in the same `build` function, the\n`context` argument to the `build` function can't be used to find the\n[Scaffold] (since it's \"above\" the widget being returned in the widget\ntree). In such cases, the following technique with a [Builder] can be used\nto provide a new scope with a [BuildContext] that is \"under\" the\n[Scaffold]:",
