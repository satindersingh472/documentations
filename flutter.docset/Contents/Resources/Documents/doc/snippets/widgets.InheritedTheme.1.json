    "description": "This example demonstrates how `InheritedTheme.capture()` can be used\nto wrap the contents of a new route with the inherited themes that\nare present when the route was built - but are not present when route\nis actually shown.\n\nIf the same code is run without `InheritedTheme.capture(), the\nnew route's Text widget will inherit the \"something must be wrong\"\nfallback text style, rather than the default text style defined in MyApp.",
