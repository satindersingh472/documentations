    "description": "This example creates a custom [Action] subclass `ModifyAction` for modifying\na model, and another, `SaveAction` for saving it.\n\nThis example demonstrates passing arguments to the [Intent] to be carried to\nthe [Action]. Actions can get data either from their own construction (like\nthe `model` in this example), or from the intent passed to them when invoked\n(like the increment `amount` in this example).\n\nThis example also demonstrates how to use Intents to limit a widget's\ndependencies on its surroundings. The `SaveButton` widget defined in this\nexample can invoke actions defined in its ancestor widgets, which can be\ncustomized to match the part of the widget tree that it is in. It doesn't\nneed to know about the `SaveAction` class, only the `SaveIntent`, and it\nonly needs to know about a value notifier, not the entire model.",
