    "description": "This example uses a [GestureDetector] that wraps a green [Container] and a second\nGestureDetector that wraps a yellow Container. The second GestureDetector is\na child of the green Container.\nBoth GestureDetectors define an onTap callback. When the callback is called it\nadds a red border to the corresponding Container.\n\nWhen the green Container is tapped, it's parent GestureDetector enters\nthe gesture arena. It wins because there is no competing GestureDetector and\nthe green Container shows a red border.\nWhen the yellow Container is tapped, it's parent GestureDetector enters\nthe gesture arena. The GestureDetector that wraps the green Container also\nenters the gesture arena (the pointer events coordinates are inside both\nGestureDetectors bounds). The GestureDetector that wraps the yellow Container\nwins because it was the first detector to enter the arena.\n\nThis example sets [debugPrintGestureArenaDiagnostics] to true.\nThis flag prints useful information about gesture arenas.\n\nChanging the [GestureDetector.behavior] property to [HitTestBehavior.translucent]\nor [HitTestBehavior.opaque] has no impact: both GestureDetectors send a [GestureRecognizer]\ninto the gesture arena, only one wins.",
