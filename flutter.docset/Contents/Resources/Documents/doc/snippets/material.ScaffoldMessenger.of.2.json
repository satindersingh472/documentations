    "description": "Sometimes [SnackBar]s are produced by code that doesn't have ready access\nto a valid [BuildContext]. One such example of this is when you show a\nSnackBar from a method outside of the `build` function. In these\ncases, you can assign a [GlobalKey] to the [ScaffoldMessenger]. This\nexample shows a key being used to obtain the [ScaffoldMessengerState]\nprovided by the [MaterialApp].",
