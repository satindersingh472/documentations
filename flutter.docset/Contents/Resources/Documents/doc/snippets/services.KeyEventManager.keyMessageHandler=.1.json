    "description": "This example shows how to process key events that are not handled by any\nfocus handler (such as `Shortcuts`) by patching [keyMessageHandler].\n\nThe app prints out any key events that are not handled by the app body.\nTry typing something in the first text field. These key presses are not\nhandled by `Shortcuts` and will be sent to the fallback handler and printed\nout. Now try some text shortcuts, such as Ctrl+A. The KeyA press is\nhandled as a shortcut, and is not sent to the fallback handler and so is\nnot printed out.\n\nThe key widget is `FallbackKeyEventRegistrar`, a necessity class to allow\nreversible patching. `FallbackFocus` and `FallbackFocusNode` are also\nuseful to recognize the widget tree's structure. `FallbackDemo` is an\nexample of using them in an app.",
