    "description": "The following example shows a widget that hides its content one second\nafter being hovered, and also exposes the enter and exit callbacks.\nBecause the widget conditionally creates the `MouseRegion`, and leaks the\nhover state, it needs to take the restriction into consideration. In this\ncase, since it has access to the event that triggers the disappearance of\nthe `MouseRegion`, it simply trigger the exit callback during that event\nas well.",
