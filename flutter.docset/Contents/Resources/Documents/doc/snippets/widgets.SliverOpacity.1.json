    "description": "This example shows a [SliverList] when the `_visible` member field is true,\nand hides it when it is false.\n\nThis is more efficient than adding and removing the sliver child widget from\nthe tree on demand, but it does not affect how much the list scrolls (the\n[SliverList] is still present, merely invisible).",
