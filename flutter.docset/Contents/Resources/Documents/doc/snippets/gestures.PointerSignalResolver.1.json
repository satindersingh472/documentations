    "description": "Here is an example that demonstrates the effect of not using the resolver\nversus using it.\n\nWhen this example is set to _not_ use the resolver, then triggering the\nmouse wheel over the outer box will cause only the outer box to change\ncolor, but triggering the mouse wheel over the inner box will cause _both_\nthe outer and the inner boxes to change color (because they're both\nreceiving the event).\n\nWhen this example is set to _use_ the resolver, then only the box located\ndirectly under the cursor will change color when the mouse wheel is\ntriggered.",
