    "description": "This sample shows how to implement a rudimentary `CopyableText` widget\nthat responds to Ctrl-C by copying its own content to the clipboard.\n\nif `CopyableText` is to be provided in a package, developers using the\nwidget may want to change how copying is handled. As the author of the\npackage, you can enable that by making the corresponding [Action]\noverridable. In the second part of the code sample, three `CopyableText`\nwidgets are used to build a verification code widget which overrides the\n\"copy\" action by copying the combined numbers from all three `CopyableText`\nwidgets.",
