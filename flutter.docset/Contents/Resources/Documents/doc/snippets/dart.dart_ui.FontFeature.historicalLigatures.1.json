    "description": "The Cardo font supports the `hlig` feature. It has legacy\nligatures for \"VI\" and \"NT\", and various ligatures involving the\n\"long s\". In the example below, both historical forms (`hist 1`)\nand historical ligatures (`hlig 1`) are enabled, so, for\ninstance, \"fish\" becomes \"fiſh\" which is then rendered using a\nligature for the last two characters.\n\nSimilarly, the word \"business\" is turned into \"buſineſſ\" by\n`hist`, and the `ſi` and `ſſ` pairs are ligated by `hlig`.\nObserve in particular the position of the dot of the \"i\" in\n\"business\" in the various combinations of these features.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_historical.png)",
