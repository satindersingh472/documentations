    "description": "This sample shows three rows of buttons, each grouped by a\n[FocusTraversalGroup], each with different traversal order policies. Use tab\ntraversal to see the order they are traversed in. The first row follows a\nnumerical order, the second follows a lexical order (ordered to traverse\nright to left), and the third ignores the numerical order assigned to it and\ntraverses in widget order.",
