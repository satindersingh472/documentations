    "description": "The Kufam font supports the `pnum` feature. It causes the digits\nto become proportionally-sized, rather than all being the same\nwidth. In this font this is especially noticeable with the digit\n\"1\": normally, the 1 has very noticeable serifs in this\nsans-serif font, but with the proportionally figures enabled,\nthe digit becomes much narrower.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_pnum.png)",
