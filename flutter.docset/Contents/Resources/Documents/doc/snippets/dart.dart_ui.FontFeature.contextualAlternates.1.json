It causes some\nletters in close proximity to other instances of themselves to\nuse different glyphs, to give the appearance of more variation\nin the glyphs, rather than having each letter always use a\nparticular glyph.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_calt.png)",
