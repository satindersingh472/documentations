    "description": "By default, if items are inserted at the \"top\" of a scrolling container like\n[ListView] or [CustomScrollView], the top item and all of the items below it\nare scrolled downwards. In some applications, it's preferable to have the\ntop of the list just grow upwards, without changing the scroll position.\nThis example demonstrates how to do that with a [CustomScrollView] with\ntwo [SliverList] children, and the [CustomScrollView.center] set to the key\nof the bottom SliverList. The top one SliverList will grow upwards, and the\nbottom SliverList will grow downwards.",
