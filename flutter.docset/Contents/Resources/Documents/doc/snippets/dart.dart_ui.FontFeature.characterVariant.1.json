    "description": "The Source Code Pro font supports the `cvXX` feature for several\ncharacters. In the example below, variants 1 (`cv01`), 2\n(`cv02`), and 4 (`cv04`) are selected. Variant 1 changes the\nrendering of the \"a\" character, variant 2 changes the lowercase\n\"g\" character, and variant 4 changes the lowercase \"i\" and \"l\"\ncharacters. There are also variants (not shown here) that\ncontrol the rendering of various greek characters such as beta\nand theta.\n\nNotably, this can be contrasted with the stylistic sets, where\nthe set which affects the \"a\" character also affects beta, and\nthe set which affects the \"g\" character also affects theta and\ndelta.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_cvXX.png)",
