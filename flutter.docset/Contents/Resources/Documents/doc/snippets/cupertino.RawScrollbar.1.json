    "description": "This sample shows an app with two scrollables in the same route. Since by\ndefault, there is one [PrimaryScrollController] per route, and they both have a\nscroll direction of [Axis.vertical], they would both try to attach to that\ncontroller on mobile platforms. The [Scrollbar] cannot support multiple\npositions attached to the same controller, so one [ListView], and its\n[Scrollbar] have been provided a unique [ScrollController]. Desktop\nplatforms do not automatically attach to the PrimaryScrollController,\nrequiring [ScrollView.primary] to be true instead in order to use the\nPrimaryScrollController.\n\nAlternatively, a new PrimaryScrollController could be created above one of\nthe [ListView]s.",
