    "description": "This example shows how to wrap another widget in a [Focus] widget to make it\nfocusable. It wraps a [Container], and changes the container's color when it\nis set as the [FocusManager.primaryFocus].\n\nIf you also want to handle mouse hover and/or keyboard actions on a widget,\nconsider using a [FocusableActionDetector], which combines several different\nwidgets to provide those capabilities.",
