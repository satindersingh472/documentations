It causes\nsome glyphs to be rendered differently, for example the \"a\" and\n\"g\" glyphs change from their typographically common\ndouble-storey forms to simpler single-storey forms, the dollar\nsign's line changes from discontinuous to continuous (and is\nangled), and the \"0\" rendering changes from a center dot to a\nslash.\n\n![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/dart-ui/font_feature_salt.png)",
