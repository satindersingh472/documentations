    "description": "This slightly more complicated, but more flexible, example creates a custom\n[Action] subclass to increment and decrement within a widget (a [Column])\nthat has keyboard focus. When the user presses the up and down arrow keys,\nthe counter will increment and decrement a data model using the custom\nactions.\n\nOne thing that this demonstrates is passing arguments to the [Intent] to be\ncarried to the [Action]. This shows how actions can get data either from\ntheir own construction (like the `model` in this example), or from the\nintent passed to them when invoked (like the increment `amount` in this\nexample).",
