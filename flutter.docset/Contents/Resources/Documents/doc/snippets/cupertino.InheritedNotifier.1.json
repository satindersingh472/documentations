    "description": "This example shows three spinning squares that use the value of the notifier\non an ancestor [InheritedNotifier] (`SpinModel`) to give them their\nrotation. The [InheritedNotifier] doesn't need to know about the children,\nand the `notifier` argument doesn't need to be an animation controller, it\ncan be anything that implements [Listenable] (like a [ChangeNotifier]).\n\nThe `SpinModel` class could just as easily listen to another object (say, a\nseparate object that keeps the value of an input or data model value) that\nis a [Listenable], and get the value from that. The descendants also don't\nneed to have an instance of the [InheritedNotifier] in order to use it, they\njust need to know that there is one in their ancestry. This can help with\ndecoupling widgets from their models.",
